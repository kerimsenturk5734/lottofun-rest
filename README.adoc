== Project Overview

Lottofun REST API is a lottery game backend system built using Spring Boot. It supports managing draws, tickets, and prizes with JWT-based authentication. The application provides RESTful endpoints to interact with the lottery functionalities and ensures secure access through token authentication.

== Functionalities

- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Create and manage lottery draws with configurable timing
- Purchase tickets for upcoming draws
- Automatic prize calculation based on configurable multipliers
- View past draws and results
- REST API documented with Swagger UI and Postman Collection

== Configuration Properties

The application uses Spring Boot's `@ConfigurationProperties` to externalize and group related configuration settings. Below are the key configuration groups and their respective default values.

=== Draw Configuration

Controls the timing of lottery draws.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Description | Default Value

| `lottofun.draw.nextDrawInterval`
| Time in milliseconds until the next draw result is published after the previous one ends. This includes the draw preparation and ticket purchase period.
| `100000`

| `lottofun.draw.closeBeforeDrawMillis`
| The number of milliseconds before a draw starts when ticket sales must be closed. Must be smaller than `nextDrawInterval`, or the app will throw a validation error at startup.
| `20000`
|===

=== Ticket Configuration

Defines ticket-related constraints.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Description | Default Value

| `lottofun.ticket.price`
| The price of a single ticket. Must be between 0 and 100.
| `10.0`
|===

=== Prize Configuration

Specifies the reward multipliers for different prize tiers.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Description | Default Value

| `lottofun.prize.jackpotFactor`
| Multiplier for the jackpot tier. Players win this times the ticket price.
| `3.0`

| `lottofun.prize.highFactor`
| Multiplier for high-tier winners.
| `2.5`

| `lottofun.prize.mediumFactor`
| Multiplier for medium-tier winners.
| `2.0`

| `lottofun.prize.lowFactor`
| Multiplier for low-tier winners.
| `1.5`
|===

=== JWT Configuration

Configuration properties for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT). These values are **required** for the application to start successfully.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Description | Required / Constraints

| `lottofun.jwt.secret`
| Secret key used to sign and validate JWTs. Must be **at least 32 characters** long. Without this key, the authentication mechanism will not work.
| Required, minimum length: 32

| `lottofun.jwt.expiration`
| Token expiration duration in milliseconds. Determines how long a JWT is valid after being issued.
| Required
|===

== Environment Variables

The following environment variables configure the core behavior of the Lottofun REST API. They can be set in your deployment environment (e.g., in `docker-compose.yml` or your CI/CD pipeline).

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Variable Name | Description

| `LOTTOFUN_JWT_SECRET`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.jwt.secret`

| `LOTTOFUN_JWT_EXPIRATION`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.jwt.ecpiration`

| `LOTTOFUN_DRAW_NEXT_DRAW_INTERVAL`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.draw.nextDrawInterval`

| `LOTTOFUN_DRAW_CLOSE_BEFORE_DRAW_MILLIS`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.draw.closeBeforeDrawMillis`

| `LOTTOFUN_TICKET_PRICE`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.ticket.price`

| `LOTTOFUN_PRIZE_JACKPOT_FACTOR`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.prize.jackpotFactor`

| `LOTTOFUN_PRIZE_HIGH_FACTOR`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.draw.highFactor`

| `LOTTOFUN_PRIZE_MEDIUM_FACTOR`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.draw.mediumFactor`

| `LOTTOFUN_PRIZE_LOW_FACTOR`
| Refers to application property -> `lottofun.draw.lowFactor`
|===

== Installation
=== Requirements

* Docker Engine (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Project source files (pom.xml, src, mvnw, .mvn folder, Dockerfile)

=== Run with Docker Compose

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

Docker going to pull required images and build the project with maven wrappers.(This may take a while)

== API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

* http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

Or you can import link:./src/main/resources/postman-collection.json[Postman Collection] json file here
